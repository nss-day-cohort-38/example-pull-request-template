# Using a Pull Request Template

1. In your project's root directory, create a `.github` directory
2. In that directory create a file called `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`. It must be named exactly like that in order for Github to recognize the file as a Pull Request Template.
3. Open the file in VSCode,  create a template that your team would like to use when creating Pull Requests. You may use the `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` in this repository as a starting point. Make sure to copy the [raw content](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nss-day-cohort-38/example-pull-request-template/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) to get the correct formatting. 
    - Use this [cheatsheet](https://github.com/tchapi/markdown-cheatsheet/blob/master/README.md) if you need help with formatting the page.
